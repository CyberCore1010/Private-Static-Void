This is my first push to the Private Static void repo and it's just to get what I currently have up on GitHub.<br/>
Current Features include:
* Working menu:
  * Hover buttons
  * Music
  * Options menu used to turn the music volume up or down
* Beginning of level 1:
  * Music
  * Sprites
  * Movement
  * Collision Detection
  * Object Interactivity
  * Dialogue system
  * Lighting system (Currently only supports one light at a time)
<br/>
Everything is handcoded using swing and default java libraries only, to prove that swing is not nearly as bad as people say it is. (Please note: I do not condone regular use of swing in a game development environment, please use openGL for a much smoother experiance)
